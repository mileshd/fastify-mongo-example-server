# Fastify Mongo Example Server

In this example, we have a local mongo db server running on localhost, with a database named 'mongo-test-db', and a collection named 'users'.

Ensure you have this database and collection with some existing data, or change the names in the file to match the corresponding names you created on your computer.

Look to the package.json file for scripts to run and develop this example server.
